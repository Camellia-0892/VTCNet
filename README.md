# VTCNet

In this study, we used the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) online platform for code writing, running, and testing. You can import our test code by creating a new file in Kaggle and selecting import.

The code runs with just **one click**.

To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of our VTCNet model, we employed 5-fold cross-validation for all experiments. In this approach, the dataset is divided into five folds: one fold is used as the validation set, and from the remaining four folds, 5% of the data from each fold is combined to form the test set, while the rest constitutes the training set.
